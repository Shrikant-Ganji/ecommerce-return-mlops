# 🏍️ E-Commerce Product Return Prediction — End-to-End MLOps Project

---

## 1. Overview

This project showcases a production-grade **end-to-end MLOps workflow** to predict whether a purchased product will be returned in an e-commerce platform. The primary aim is to reduce costs associated with product returns by predicting them ahead of time using historical data and deploying the model in a scalable, automated, and monitorable setup.

It incorporates:

* 🧠 **Machine Learning model** trained using historical e-commerce data
* 🚀 **Prefect 2.0** to orchestrate the entire pipeline
* 📈 **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registry
* ⚙️ **FastAPI** for real-time model serving
* 🧪 **Evidently AI** for automated model/data drift monitoring
* 📦 **Docker** to containerize the services
* ☁️ **Render** for deployment (using Terraform)
* ↻ **CI/CD pipeline** via GitHub Actions

By combining modular design and modern tooling, this project adheres to **MLOps best practices**, ensuring automation, scalability, versioning, monitoring, and reproducibility.

## 2. Problem Description

Product returns pose a significant cost for online retailers. Early prediction of such events allows companies to optimize logistics, personalize experiences, or flag risky orders for manual review.

**Problem Statement**: Can we predict whether an item will be returned using structured historical data from customer orders, product types, payment history, and reviews?

**ML Objective**: Train a binary classification model to predict `return_status` (0 = No Return, 1 = Return) based on customer behavior, product metadata, and transactional features.

## 3. Dataset Information

We use the **Olist E-commerce Dataset** (from Kaggle/UCI):

* **Size**: \~100k orders across 9 CSV files
* **Source**: Brazilian e-commerce platform
* **Files include**:

  * `olist_orders.csv`: order metadata
  * `olist_order_items.csv`: items per order
  * `olist_customers.csv`: customer demographics
  * `olist_products.csv`: product categories
  * `olist_order_reviews.csv`: customer ratings
  * `olist_order_payments.csv`: payment details

> All raw files are stored under `data/raw/`, and processed files under `data/processed/` in `.parquet` format.
