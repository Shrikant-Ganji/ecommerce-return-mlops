# 🛍️ Ecommerce Return Prediction — End-to-End MLOps Project

This repository demonstrates a complete **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** using:

* **Prefect 2.0** for orchestration and scheduled deployments
* **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registry
* **Evidently AI** for monitoring data drift
* **Scikit-learn + Joblib** for modeling
* **GitHub Codespaces + Render** for development and deployment
* **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
* **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (planned)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Predict product returns in an e-commerce platform using historical order, customer, and product data. The project includes all key MLOps stages:

* Data preprocessing
* Model training and tracking
* Pipeline orchestration
* Model deployment (optional)
* Data drift monitoring
* Automation via CI/CD

## 📦 Module Details

### 🗃️ `data/`

* `raw/`: Contains original Olist e-commerce dataset CSVs.
* `processed/`: Preprocessed Parquet files: `train`, `test`, `X`, `y` splits.
* `predictions.csv`: Output file from inference pipeline.

### 🧠 `src/`

* `data_prep.py`: Loads raw data, handles missing values, encodes, and splits.
* `train.py`: Trains a Random Forest model, tracks with MLflow.
* `predict.py`: Generates predictions using the trained model.
* `utils.py`: Shared helper functions.

### 📓 `notebooks/`

* `eda.ipynb`: Explore distributions, missing values, correlations.
* `feature_engineering.ipynb`: Encoding, scaling, and transformation logic.
* `model_training.ipynb`: Model experimentation + MLflow logging walkthrough.

### 🧪 `models/`

* `return_model.joblib`: Final serialized version of the trained model.

### 📁 `mlruns/`, `mlflow.db`

* MLflow tracking backend for:

  * Parameters
  * Metrics (Accuracy, F1-score)
  * Artifacts (model.pkl, conda.yaml, envs)

---

## ⚙️ Prefect 2.0 Orchestration

### 🧵 `pipelines/prefect_flow.py`

Defines `@flow` called `full_pipeline()`:

* Loads → preprocesses → trains → evaluates → predicts → monitors drift

### 🧾 `prefect.yaml`

* CLI-generated deployment config
* Allows you to run via:

```bash
prefect deploy -n "Ecommerce Return Pipeline"
```

### 🧪 `prefect/run_monitoring_flow.py`

* Triggers monitoring task separately via CLI or script

### 🧾 `run_deployment.py`

* On-demand triggering of full Prefect pipeline

---

## 🛰️ Deployment Modules

### ⚙️ `deployment/app.py`

* Optional FastAPI app for serving predictions via `/predict`

### 🧾 `deployment/service.yaml`

* Kubernetes/Render-compatible YAML deployment descriptor

---

## 📊 Monitoring with Evidently

### 🧭 `monitoring/evidently_monitor.py`

* Generates drift report by comparing reference vs current dataset
* Runs as Prefect task or cronjob

### 📊 `monitoring/evidently_report.html`

* Output HTML report from Evidently with visual metrics

---

## ✅ Tests

### 🔍 `test_predict.py`

* Verifies that the saved model loads and makes predictions
* Ensures CI/CD test automation

---

## 🐍 Setup & Usage

### 🔧 Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n mlops311 python=3.11 -y
conda activate mlops311
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🚦 Start Prefect Server & Worker

```bash
prefect server start
prefect worker start -q default
```

### 🚀 Deploy the Pipeline

```bash
prefect deploy pipelines/prefect_flow.py:full_pipeline \
  -n "Ecommerce Return Pipeline" \
  -q "default" \
  -p "default-agent-pool"
```

### 🔁 Trigger Manual Run

```bash
prefect deployment run 'ecommerce-return-mlops/Ecommerce Return Pipeline'
```
